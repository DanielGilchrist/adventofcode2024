# Input structure
Input isn't committed to this repo. See: https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_copying

This is the expected structure. Note for days where the input doesn't change between parts they should both just use part1.txt
```txt
- src/
  - input/
    - day1/
      - part1.txt
    - day2/
      - part2.txt
    ...
    - day20/
      - part1.txt
      - part2.txt
```
